                        <h4>Phuket is the largest island in Thailand, located in the Andaman Sea of southern Thailand.</h4>
                         <p> A quarter of a million people call Phuket their home with most being Thai and Chinese. “Phuket” means mountain jewel and with that offers wildlife sanctuaries and national parks in the north and hedonistic experiences on beatiful beaches, cultures, fabulous thai food and much more</p>
                         <p>Phuket is one of Thailand's premier tourist destinations and (basic) English is widely spoken, especially in the beach areas. Phuket has over 30 beaches of which Patong is the most popular and well-known.</p>

                         <h4>History</h4>
                         <p>Phuket was known for centuries as an important trading post on the eastern shore of the Bay of Bengal, with busy ports seeing shiploads of goods come and go, along with their merchant crews from Arab and Malay worlds, as well as India, Burma, China and Siam.

When large tin deposits were discovered in the 16th Century, Phuket was colonized by Portuguese, French, and British traders looking to set up shop. A century later, the British were contemplating control of the vital trade passage through the Strait of Malacca, using Phuket as their base of operations.</p>

                         <h4>Phuket town</h4>
                         <p>Phuket Old Town is the provincial capital of Phuket, it is a historically rich part of town where you will see an abundance of temples (Chinese and Buddhist), beautiful ‘shophouses’, small printing shops and a disused red light district. The Old Town was created during a boom many years ago when metal was a valuable commodity. The town itself is not that big so you can easily walk around it rather than taking any transport and has a large selection of restaurants to stop for something to eat.</p>

                <p>Thai food - as exotic as it is - needs no introduction. Nowadays you can find at least one Thai restaurant in most western towns but Thai food in Thailand itself is a whole new experience. The juxtaposition of sweet, sour, hot and salty flavours is what makes Thai cuisine so distinct and nowhere is it more noticeable than in the Thai national soup tom yam.</p>

                         <p>Thai people are often incredibly friendly, and many do smile at you on the street.
